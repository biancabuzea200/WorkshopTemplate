#### Getting ERC20 tokens in exchange for ETH

1. We are ready to test our dApp. To do so, we will send some test ETH on Sepolia to the TokenVendorâ€™s address, and we should get in exchange some ERC20 token.

```bash
cast send $TOKEN_VENDOR_ADDRESS  --value 0.01ether  --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```
